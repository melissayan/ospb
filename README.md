#  Ontology for Sepsis Peripheral intravenous catheter-related Bloodstream infections (OSPB)
---

The Ontology for Sepsis Peripheral intravenous catheter-related Bloodstream infections (OSPB) is a preliminary early sepsis sign ontology.  As OSPB is in the initial development phases, much work still needs to be done. Developed using [Protégé version 5.5.0](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege), OSPB is accessible from the repository's `ospb.owl` file. 

This repository contains the preliminary early sepsis sign ontology described in the manuscript submitted to [BMC Bioinformatics Supplements](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements) as a selected article from the Biological Ontologies and Knowledge bases (BiOK) workshop 2021:
